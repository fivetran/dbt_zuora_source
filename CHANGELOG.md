ðŸŽ‰ Initial Release ðŸŽ‰
- This is the initial release of this package. 

This package is designed to enrich your Fivetran Zuora data by doing the following:

- Cleans, tests, and prepares your Zuora data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zuora) for analysis.
- Add descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran.
- Add freshness tests to source data.
- Add column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Model staging tables which leverage data in the format described [here](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/zuora#schemainformation), which can then be used simultaneously with our [Zuora modeling transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_zuora).
- Currently the package supports Postgres, Redshift, BigQuery, Databricks, and Snowflake. Additionally, this package is designed to work with dbt versions [">=1.3.0", "<2.0.0"].
