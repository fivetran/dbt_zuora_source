{% enddocs %}

{% docs product_rate_plan_table %}

{% docs rate_plan_charge_table %}
A rate plan charge is part of a subscription or an amendment to a subscription, and it comes from a product rate plan charge. Rate plan charges represent the actual charges for the rate plans or services that you sell.

{% docs refund_table %}
A refund returns money to a customer - as opposed to a credit, which creates a customer credit balance that may be applied to reduce the amount owed to you. Electronic refunds are processed by Zuora via a payment gateway.
External refunds indicate that the refund was processed outside of Zuora, say by a check, and the transaction must be recorded.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs refund_invoice_payment_table %}
This table exports information on refunds attributed to invoice payments.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs subscription_table %}
A subscription is a product or service that has recurring charges, such as a monthly flat fee or charges based on usage. Subscriptions can also include one-time charges, such as activation fees. Every subscription must be associated with an account. At least one active account must exist before any subscriptions can be created.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs taxation_item_table %}
Used to add a tax amount to an invoice item. Changes that you make with this object affect the product charges in your product catalog, but not the charges in existing subscriptions.
